# Week-1-Homework

# Index.html
The orginal website looked like this;

There were alot of <div></div> tags pretty much exclusively those throughout the index.html file. 

I went through the index.html located the header, body, main, footer and added the appropriate tags. The images had to alt="" description on them so I had to ensure those were on each one as well. 

I changed alot of the div tags to section after breaking it down into a more readable semantic format. After breaking it down this way I also folowed through the CSS document and noticed that it didn't flow that well. Like the .header was at the bottom and the body was also at the bottom. I wanted to bring this up so that it was easier to flow through the documents when they were side by side. Like this;

After changing the HTML and CSS around slightly to make it easier to read and understand, the website still looked and functioned the same as before but now it's easier to read;
